## What is Trello?

Trello is a visual tool for work management that champions collaboration and organisation on
projects.

### Workspaces vs Boards?

When using Trello, you will come across terms such as Workspaces and Boards. A workspace represents
the overarching team/department/product you work within or on. At Thoth Tech, our workspaces are
represented by the product you are working on (eg SplashKit). Each workspace contains one or more
boards within. Boards are used to represent projects or teams within the workspace. Thoth Tech
divides their boards into teams.

#### **How to navigate Workspaces and Boards**

Workspaces can be found and navigated under the "Workspaces" tab at the top left of the screen. A
drop-down list will appear with all the workspaces you are a member of.

To access boards, you need to select a workspace. You can view a list of the boards within a
workspace by selecting the "Boards" tab on the left hand side menu. Below this is the My Boards
section. It will show the boards that you are a member of within the current workspace.

#### **How to Favourite boards**

In the "My Boards" section of the left menu, you can favourite boards that you use most often. These
will be pushed to the top of this list. Favourite boards can be accessed regardless of which
workspace you have currently selected. This is done by selecting the "Starred" option on the top
menu. Favouriting allows for quick navigation between your active projects. This is handy when you
have joined a large number of boards across multiple workspaces.

## Basics of how to use Trello

### What is a card?

Cards are the units that make up a Trello board. They can represent anything inlcuding:

- tasks
- user stories
- epics
- details/general information.

The main form for cards within Thoth Tech's boards will be as tasks.

### How do I move a card?

There are three ways to move a card on a board.

1. Drag and drop a card into the desired column.
2. Hover over the card until the edit pencil appears. From here you can select "Move", and choose
   the board, column and position you want to move it to
3. Open the card to view all its details. On the right hand side menu, you can find the "Move"
   option under the "Actions" header. Select "Move", and choose the board, column and position you
   want to move it to

### When do I move a card?

A card can be moved for multiple reasons. It can be moved from the backlog into the current sprint,
it can be moved when you pick it up to work on it and again when you finish your work on it.

### How can I monitor a card's progress?

An easy way to monitor a card is to subscribe to notifications for the card. There are two ways to
do this. You can open a card and press "Join", but this should only be done if you are actively
working on a card. To get notifications without joining a card, you can select "Watch" which is
under the "Action" header on the right hand side of the card.

### What do I write for a description?

A description should succinctly tell anyone who could pick up the card its background, knowledge and
resources required, steps on how to complete it and its definition of done. You should be able to
read a card's description and immediately be able to action it.

### What do I put in the Activity section?

The activity section keeps track of all changes made to a card. It will show edits, comments and
moves from column to column. Comments should be added when issues arise, when new information is
found, or if you need to clarify something with your delivery lead/colleagues. Often this will be
utilised during the testing phase. If a test fails, the tester can leave details of the issue on the
card and reassign it to the developer, allowing them to input the neccessary changes.

### Card templates

For cards that have similar structure or tasks that will be repeated over and over, you can create a
card and designate it as a template. By writing cards in a formulaic or structured way, it allows
you to create multiple cards with the same elaborate structures by copying the template and altering
smaller details. A card can be designated as a template by ticking the "Template" option under the
"Action" header on the right hand side menu.

## Skills/Features

### Assign People to Cards

Member assignment to Trello cards allows team members and the delivery lead to know who is currently
working on a specific card or task. This makes it easier to determine who to contact if new
information arises for a task or if a specific card is a blocker for your own current card.

To assign a person to a card, select the card you want to assign the person to bring up its details.

#### **If assigning yourself**

Navigate to the menu on the right hand side of the card, select "Join". Your initials should appear
at the top of the card next to the "Members" header.

#### **If assigning someone else:**

Navigate to the menu on the right hand side of the card, select "Members". In the search box, search
the name of the team member you would like to add. Select their name. Their initials should appear
at the top of the card next to the "Members" header.

### Create and Assign Labels

Labels are a handy tool within Trello that allow you to add context to a card. These labels could
represent the projects being undertaken on the board, the semester/time that the work is expected to
be undertaken, or anything that you think is required to be categorised.

#### **Creating Labels**

At the top of the Trello board, there are some tabs that run to the right hand side of the board.
The furthest right tab is labelled "Show menu". Selecting this will bring up a menu with additional
functions.

Select "More". An option for "Labels" will appear. Pressing this will show six default colours.
Selecting the edit pencil will allow you to add a title to the label.

If all 6 colours are in use, select "Create a new label". This will give you options for 4 other
colours or to double up on a colour (not recommended). You can also create a label without a colour.
It will not appear on the board but can be viewed when the card is selected.

#### Assigning Labels

Hover over the card that you want to assign a label to and select the edit pencil icon. An option to
"Edit Labels" will appear. Selecting this will bring up the "Labels" menu as shown above. Here you
can assign pre-made labels or create a new one.

### Setting Up Columns

Creating a column is quite simple. At the top of the board there is an option to "Add a list". Enter
the title for the column and save. You can create as many columns as you like.

There is no set way to organise columns within an Agile framework. The basic three columns you need
are:

- To Do
- In Progress
- Completed

At Thoth Tech, we recommend adding a few extra columns to ensure that the board is more informative,
and easier to use. Here is the list of columns that are recommended, in order:

- Epic
  - Cards in this column should break down the epic for each project, using the Epic Markdown
    Template to set up. These cards should never be moved.
- User Stories
  - All user stories extracted from each epic should be located in this column. These cards should
    only be moved once the user story is completely exhausted.
- Product Backlog
  - All the tasks extracted from the user stories belong in this column. They will remain there
    until they have been added to a new sprint in a sprint planning session.
- Sprint Backlog
  - Contains all cards that have been planned to be completed in the current sprint.
- In Progress/Doing
  - When a team member assigns themselves to a card, it should be moved into this column. It remains
    in this column until the task is completed.
- Done
  - Cards in this column have been completed, waiting on testing/review to be completed. This column
    acts as a buffer, which makes it easier to see which cards need testing and when a card is no
    longer in progress. When in the done column, the card should have its member unassigned.
- Testing/Review
  - Cards in this column have been picked up to ensure the quality of work and that it is coherent,
    documented and works properly. If everything is good and the delivery lead is happy, the card
    can be moved to the completed column. If the card is not ready or needs work, comments are to be
    left in the activity section on how to fix. Then the card needs to be moved back to in progress
    and assigned to the original team member working on it. It is good practice to never have the
    same person testing a card that they developed, just to ensure transparency.
- Blocked
  - This column is where cards are to be moved if major issues are found or they are waiting on work
    within another card to be completed. This column is of high priority and ideally needs to be
    actioned immediately.
- Completed
  - All tasks that are successfully completed should be in this column.

### Adding Checklists to Cards

Checklists are a simple way to track progress of a task as they show how many subtasks have been
completed for each task. This progress will appear in the bottom left corner of a card when looking
at the board.

To attach a checklist to a card, select the card and navigate to the menu on the right hand side.
The third option under the "Add to card" header is "Checklists". Selecting this allows you to title
the checklist, and to automatically populate the checklist if it is the same as a checklist on
another card.

From here, a checklist header will appear in the main section of the card above "Activity". Select
the "Add an item" button, which will allow you to create a new item for the checklist. There is no
limit on number of items to add to a checklist, but if a task has too many subtasks, consider either
breaking the task down or turning the task into a new user story.

### Adding Attachments

You can attach images, UML diagrams, Trello cards and many other items to a Trello Card. This gives
a card greater context. To add an attachment, select the target card and go to the menu on the right
hand side. Under "Add to card" you will find an option for "Attachments". From here, select where
the attachment you want to add is currently located. This will prompt you to browse for and select
your desired item to attach. Attached items will appear just below the description of the card.

### Adding Stickers to Cards

You can personalise your board by using stickers. By selecting the "Show menu" option at the top
right of the page, you will find an option for stickers. There are pre-loaded stickers to be used,
as well as options to add your own images and GIFs to be used as stickers on your board.

### How To Link Cards

## Power-ups (Plugins):

When you select a card, there is an option to add Power-ups. These are extra tools that you can
utilise to better streamline your board and the Agile process. Below are two popular examples of
Power-ups that you can utilise, but there are many more that can be accessed and utilised.

### Agile

There are two Power-ups that are recommended to use within your Trello board to make it more Agile.
Corello have created a Power-up called `Agile Tools` which allows Story Points to be added to cards,
whilst the Power-up `Limit Lists` allows a team to set work in progress limits on columns.

To install a Power-up, select the Power-ups menu option at the top of your Trello board. This will
show all your current installed Power-ups and allow you to add more by selecting the option
`Add Power-ups`. Use the search function to look for different tools you can utilise within your
Trello board.

#### **Story Points**

Story Points are an important facet of an Agile development style, as they give context to how much
work is required, how difficult a card is, or how long a card will take to complete. There is no
hard or fast rule on how to set Story Points, but they are required to successfully plan a sprint.

A good idea to get started with Story points is to have each point represent an amount of time. Each
number can represent a length of time (1 = 1 hour or 1 day, 2 = 2 hours etc), or even represent a
range of times (1 = 1 to 2 hours work, 2 = 2 to 5 hours work). It is important set these story
points at the start of the development process. There is scope to alter them if they aren't relevant
or need work, but they should not be changed all the time or on a whim.

The information on how your teams story points work needs to be easily accessible and clear, to
ensure tasks are given the correct amount of time to complete.

Once you install `Agile Tools`, Story Points can be set by selecting a card and navigating to the
`Power-ups` heading on the right hand side of the card. A default scale of Story Points will appear
in the form of a Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21). As the numbers increase, the difficulty
or time should increase. Set the card to the Story Point level you have discussed within your Sprint
planning session.

#### **List Limits**

Adding List Limits to columns on a Trello board is an effective way to ensure that the team is
utilising Agile practices and completes work efficiently.

Often a team will find most of their members are comfortable with either the developing or the
testing side of the development cycle. This can lead to bottlenecks during a sprint where work is
not reaching a specific column because either too much is being started or there is a lack of people
picking up cards. Work in progress caps can alleviate these bottlenecks.

By setting a limit to how many cards can be in the done column, you force people to start picking up
those cards and testing them. This ensures that tasks consistently get developed to completion.
These limits will depend on how many members are on your team and how you define the roles, but
should be constantly discussed in planning meetings and retrospectives to reach an optimal value.

Once the Power-up `List Limits` is installed, list limits can be set on a column byselecting the
`...` at the top right of the column and navigating down to `Set list limit`. This allows you to set
individual limits on cards within a column. Although you can still place cards in the column, as
soon as its full you should be actioning the cards within to remove them. Each list can have a
different limit within it.
